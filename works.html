          Designing a Website

          2021 - Website

          <br />
          While in the second semester of school, we started learning about
          JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Our first major project, known as a sprint,
          was to design a functioning website that linked at least 3 pages.

          Our second major project in the second semester was to create a
          functioning social media app using React. We were provided with a
          default project and I took my inspiration from Instagram.

          <br />
          Learning the language of Python was the main focus in our first
          semester. One of our sprint projects was to create a travel claims
          processing system with multiple options for the user to choose from,
          such as entering a claim or graphing monthly claim totals. This was a
          team effort, so the credit extends to my fellow classmates Michael
          O'Reilly, Gerald Bartlett and John Byrne.

          Another sprint project from first semester was to create a system
          where the user inputs all the required information that is then
          calculated to show as a receipt. The user can also choose 1 of 4
          payment options which is calculated and displayed. This was a team
          effort, so the credit extends to my fellow classmate Michael O'Reilly.

          Robotics PowerPoint Presentation

          One of our assignments was to pick a topic we were passionate about
          and research it, followed by a PPT presentation to the rest of our
          class and instructor. My partner Michael O'Reilly and I chose
          robotics. He researched Boston Dynamics and Ouster, and I researched
          Kraken Robotics and Vicarious Surgical.
